     // UI Browser uses the other way to fix this issue, without requiring an override method; namely, to build UI Browser under macOS Mojave 10.14 or later and make all Info items conform to the Equatable and Hashable protocols. See the NSOutlineView discussion under "API Changes" in https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/appkit_release_notes_for_macos_10_14. Apple's macOS Mojave 10.14 AppKit Release Notes: "Swift value types provided as items to an NSOutlineView instance using methods such as insertItems(at:inParent:withAnimation:) need to be made both Equatable and Hashable. For more information, see Adopting Common Protocols. These conformances let NSOutlineView correctly compare items so that performance is optimal and methods like row(forItem:) can correctly find the stored item internally."

This method is designed to perform its function only if the user clicks the mouse to select a new row; it does nothing if the click is not on a row or is on an already selected row and the click therefore does not select a new row. The NSOutlineViewDelegate formal protocol outlineViewSelectionDidChange(_:) delegate method is triggered by the click immediately afterward under identical circumstances. This method sets the OutlineTabItemViewController isManualSelection flag to true before the outlineViewSelectionDidChange(_:) delegate method is triggered, to signal the delegate method to update and display the user's selection of a new row using a mouse click. Note that a click on a row's expansion button does not trigger this method.
