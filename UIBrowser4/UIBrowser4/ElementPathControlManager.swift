/**
 The ElementPathControlManager.swift file implements the ElementPathControlManager class dedicated to managing the path control in UI Browser's Master tab item's browser, outline and list views. The path control in each view behaves identically. It allows the user to open an hierarchical pop-up menu on any tab item to select a UI element anywhere in the target application's accessibility hierarchy for display in the view.
 
 UI Browser's path control is modeled on Apple's Xcode jump bar, with one major difference. UI Browser's path control reflects the current accessibility hierarchy selection path of the target application, which may not extend all the way to a leaf element because the user may have selected a shallower UI element as the current element. UI Browser's individual path item pop-up menus are used to select any sibling or child element of the element represented by the clicked path item to any depth, while the Xcode jump bar menus only allow the user to choose the leaf element of any available path. This difference reflects the fact that every level of the UI Browser hierarchy contains a UI element with useful information, while only the leaf element represented by the Xcode jump bar is a code file containing useful information.
 
 When *Main.storyboard* is loaded at launch, the path control shows a single path item, the path control's placeholder, which is set to "No Target" in Main.storyboard, and the current element view is empty. When the user chooses a target, the path control replaces the placeholder and instead displays as the first path item what is known in the accessibility world as the "root application UI element" (or the sytem-wide element if that was the chosen target), and the element view displays the root application element (or the system-wide element). The path control's action method is popUpPathControlMenu(_:) implemented in each of the master tab items. If the target is a running application and the user clicks the first path item, the action method opens a pop-up menu on it showing the root application element and a submenu indicator triangle. When the user moves the mouse, the submenu opens with menu items representing all of the child elements. The user can choose one of the children in the popup menu, and the element view then displays all of the children with the chosen child selected; typically, these are the application's menu bar element and a window element for every open application window. If the user then clicks the second path item, the action method opens a new popup menu on it showing the children of the selected window or menu bar element. The menus are hierarchical, enabling the user to choose any UI element at any deeper level of the target application's accessibility hierarchy, and the path control extends to the full depth of the chosen element.
 
 The action method for every menu item in the pop-up menu is `selectElement(_:)` implemented in each of the master tab items. It is programatically connected as the action method for every menu item in the path control. It is called once initially when the user chooses a new target while the list view is selected. It is called repeatedly thereafter when the user selects an existing element in the path control. The action method updates UI Browser's display, adding the child elements of the selected element and other views, such as the tab view items showing actions, attributes and notifications of the selected element.
 
 The menu item for the clicked path item is positioned directly over the clicked path item. That menu item may have sibling menu items above and below it representing other UI elements at the same level of the accessibility hierarchy and, if it is not a leaf element, that menu item may have an associated submenu with one or more menu items representing child elements at the next level of the accessibility hiearchy. The pop-up menu is created, configured and opened in the popUpMenu(for:) method, which is called in each element view's popUpPathControlMenu(_:) action method, including an express call to the menuNeedsUpdate(_:) delegate method.

 The key architectural feature of the `selectElement(_:)` method is that it caches all elements of the selected element hierarchy and related information in the element data model when a new element is selected, thus making access to them later more efficient. Updating the data model also makes access possible even after the selected element is destroyed (for example, if a hot key is used to select a UI element in a palette that disappears when UI Browser is brought to the front). The update actually occurs piecemeal as the user highights menu items in the path control pop-up menu using the mouse or keyboard, in the menu(_:willHighlight:) delegate method. When the user lifts the mouse from the last highlighted menu item to finalize the selection, the data model is already updated.

        // This method first sets the clickedPathItem and clickedPathItemIndex instance properties using the NSPathControl clickedPathItem computed property. It then creates the pop-up menu and makes an express call to the menuNeedsUpdate(_:) delegate method to configure it, adding menu items representing the UI elements in the level of the element data model represented by the clicked path item. These menu items enable the user to select siblings of the UI element represented by the clicked path item, using the saved clickedPathItemIndex value to associate the level of the clicked path item and the chosen menu item with the level of the accessibility hierarchy in the data model. It then gets the current position of the clicked path item within the bounds of the path control and calls the NSMenu popUp(positioning:at:in:) method to pop the menu up and position the menu item representing the clicked path item directly over the clicked path item. Popping the menu up triggers the menuNeedsUpdate(_:) delegate method, but it is designed to do nothing at this point because the top-level menu was already configured in the express call. When the user moves the mouse over any of the menu items, it triggers the menu(_:willHighlight:) delegate method, which, if the menu item represents a UI element having children, associates a submenu created in the menuNeedsUpdate(_:) delegate method with the menu item. Setting the submenu triggers the menuNeedsUpdate(_:) delegate method again, which then adds the submenu's child menu items to the submenu. The menu(_:willHighlight:) and menuNeedsUpdate(_:) delegate methods fire again every time the user moves the mouse over another menu item representing a UI element having children, creating a hierarchical menu of any depth to navigate the accessibility hierarchy starting at the level of the clicked path item. When the user eventually releases the mouse button over a menu item to choose it, the selectElement(_:) action method implemented in each of the master tab items is sent to update the element view and the window.

If the user chooses a child menu item at any deeper level of the accessibility hierarchy, the clicked path item and any path items following it are removed, a new path item representing the new sibling UI element is appended, and new path items representing the path to the selected child element are appended.

        // Optional delegate method per the NSMenuDelegate formal protocol. Apple's NSMenuDelegate documentation: "Donât modify the structure of the menu or the menu items during this method."
        // This delegate method is triggered once after each submenu in the path control pop-up menu hierarchy closes and once again after the root level menu closes. After the root menu closes, the data model will be restored using the saved current element index path if the user dismissed the menu without choosing a menu item. The saved current element index path was saved in the menuWillOpen(_:) delegate method. It will be set to nil in the selectElement(_:) action method connected to each menu item in the pop-up menu if the user does choose a menu item, or here if the user dismissed the pop-up menu, thus requiring the data model to be restored.
        // Time travel is the only way to determine whether the user chose a menu item in the pop-up menu or instead dismissed it. This is because, if the user selected a UI element by choosing a menu item, the selectElement(_:) action method connected to the menu item will be called only after the pop-up menu closes and this delegate method is triggered. Furthermore, there is no Cocoa method disclosing whether the user dismissed a menu without choosing a menu item, and by the nature of reality the absence of a call to the action method cannot be reported by the action method itself. This delegate method therefore calls NSObject perform(_:with:afterDelay:) to call the menuWasDismissed() @objc helper method in a future iteration of the run loop, after a call to selectElement(_:) -- if there will be such a call -- will have had time to execute and reset the saved current element index path to nil.

            currentElementView.window?.makeFirstResponder(currentElementView)
            perform(#selector(menuWasDismissed), with: nil, afterDelay: 0.0) // 0.0 delays to the next iteration of the run loop
        }
    }
    
    @objc func menuWasDismissed() {
        // Performed by the menuDidClose(_:) delegate method after delaying to the next iteration of the run loop to give the selectElement(_:) action method time to set the saved current element index path to nil if the user chose a menu item. If the user instead dismissed the pop-up menu, the saved current element index path will be used to restore the data model as it existed before the user clicked the path control to open the pop-up menu.
        let dataSource = ElementDataModel.sharedInstance
        // Restore the data model using the saved current element index path if the user did not choose a menu item in the path control pop-up menu.
