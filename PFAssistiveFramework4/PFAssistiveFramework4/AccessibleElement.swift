// NOTE about the AccessibleElementDelegate formal protocol and notifications.

// Designing a framework to use a delegate protocol is useful, because a client only has to adopt the protocol by implementing its declared method to take advantage of it. The client does not have to register to observe a Notification Center notification and implement the notification method, which is a slightly busier coding task and may take up additional system resources. A limitation of using a delegate protocol, however, is that the framework can have only one delegate, while notifications can be observed by multiple objects using different classes.
// If a framework supports both a delegate protocol and notifications, the client has the best of both worlds. It can make one of its classes the delegate simply by adopting the protocol and implementing the delegate method in that class. In addition, it can register any number of other classes to observe and respond to the notification. To enable the client to use both techniques without duplicating code, a single method can act both as the delegate method and as the notification method. To do this, the method must take the notification as its parameter.
// To support a delegate protocol, the framework must create an appropriate notification object and pass it as a parameter when it calls the delegate method declared in the protocol and implemented in the delegate. To support notifications as well, the framework must separately post the notification that the client registered to observe.
// A framework that supports a delegate protocol must have a reference to the delegate. A framework whose classes support a relatively small number of long-lived objects can set its public delegate property in several ways. (1) If the object is a responder such as a view or control, its delegate property can be declared as an IBOutlet and connected in Interface Builder at build time. (2) In any case, the delegate property can be set by the client using a delegate parameter in the class's initializer at run time when an instance of the class is first created. (3) The delegate property can be set programmatically by the client after the instance is created, by directly setting the delegate property.
// None of these techniques is so easy if a framework instead supports a class that will be used to create a large number of objects of the same type very frequently. That is the case with the AccessibleElement class in the PFAssistive4 Framework. Instances of AccessibleElement must potentially be created for every user interface element in the accessibility hierarchy of the application targeted by the client application. The tree of elements can grow quite large as elements deeper in the accessibility hierarchy are accessed. Many of them may be removed from the tree, as well, every time the user narrows the path at any level of the tree.
// The PFAssistive4 Framework must track the destruction of AccessibleElement objects in the user interface as windows and menus are closed and other views and controls are hidden or removed. It does this both with a delegate protocol and Notification Center notifications, to support clients that use either or both techniques. The delegate method, elementWasDestroyed(_), also serves as the notification method. The notification object is the AccessibleElement instance that called the delegate method or posted the notification when the accessibility API AXUIElement object that it wraps was destroyed. The notification's userInfo parameter passes the AccessibleElement's cachedAttributes property (the element's role, role description, subrole, help and title), because the client can no longer obtain this information directly from the element that has been destroyed. The cached information can be used to display descriptive information about any destroyed element.
// When one of the elements is destroyed in the user interface, it and its children at all levels of the tree must respond. If the elements are configured to use delegates adopting the delegate protocol, there is only one usable way to set the framework's delegate property. The first two techniques described above are either impossible or too complicated.
// (1) An AccessibleElement's delegate property cannot be connected in Interface Builder at compile time. Its delegate property can be declared as an IBOutlet, but there is no place to create the needed instances of AccessibleElement in Main.storyboard to make their delegate outlets available for connection to the client's view controller. An AccessibleElement is not a responder such as a view or control, and new ones are created constantly.
// (2) Passing the delegate in an AccessibleElement's initializer when it is created by a client object at run time would be feasible in some scenarios; for example, when an individual AccessibleElement is needed for some temporary purpose. However, it is not feasible in the context of building up an accessibility hierarchy. The AccessibleElement class has many methods that create multiple AccessibleElement objects, such as AXChildren(). They call intermediate methods such as elementArrayAttributeValue(for:), which repeatedly calls the AccessibleElement initializer. Declaring a delegate parameter in each of these methods so that the client object and these element methods can pass it along to each element in the hierarchy would complicate the framework. In any event, it is uncommon to include the delegate as a parameter in class initializers.
// (3) That leaves setting each element's delegate property after it is created, but no later than the earliest time when it might be destroyed. A client application will normally need to monitor the destruction of user interface elements as soon as they are displayed. For a client application that displays a target's elements in a table view, an outline view or a browser view, for example, the client application's data source is the appropriate place to set up the delegate property. The data source is where the client handles the data displayed by the view's controller. UI Browser, for example, uses each of these view types to display its target's current accessibility hierarchy. The AccessibleElement objects in the hierarchy are the views' data, and they are managed by the ElementDataModel data source. The views display this data after obtaining it from the data source, and the view controllers monitor which AccessibilityElements in the data source are destroyed so they can alter their views accordingly. The view controllers are the delegates that adopt the delegate protocol by implementing the delegate method to respond to the destruction of the AccessibleElements in the data source.
// In the third scenario, it is relatively easy for the data source to set each AccessibleElement's delegate property at the same time it adds the element to the accessibility hierarchy. Unlike the AccessibleElement class, which is in an independent framework bearing no inherent relationship to the client, the data source is a custom, application-specific class designed as part of the application. The data source is intimately connected with the view controller, so the necessary information is readily available to the data source.
// In the case of UI Browser, this is done in the ElementDataModel class's updateDataModelForCurrentElementAt(level:index:) method. This data source method has access to the element currently selected by the user, known as the current element, because the element is by definition already in the data source from earlier operations, such as creating the target's root application AccessibleElement instance when a new target was chosen. This data source method creates all of the current element's child AccessibleElements by calling the appropriate PFAssistive4 Framework method; namely, AXChildren(). Immediately afterward, the data source method sets each child's delegate property, and the circle is closed.
// The PFAssistive4 Framework could have implemented all appropriate methods to take a delegate parameter, as discussed above, and the data source could have used that parameter instead of setting the delegate property directly after each element was created. However, writing a delegate parameter into every framework method that creates AccessibleElement objects would add unneeded complexity to the framework. It would also be inconsistent with the basic design idea that the framework leaves it up to its client to decide whether to use the delegate protocol or instead to register to observe notifications.
// Another approach would be to write the PFAssistive4 Framework's methods so that all of them set their delegate properties within the framework by getting the delegate from the root application AccessibleElement object, and to leave it to clients to worry only about setting the delegate property of the root application element when it is created. Each AccessibleElement instance already has a reference to its root application element.  Again, however, this would be inconsistent with the basic design idea that the framework is neutral as to whether clients should use the delegate protocol or register to observe notifications. Also, the destruction observer mechanism is not implemented by application or system-wide AccessibleElement instances, as opposed to interface instances, so focusing on setting up the delegate protocol in the root application element would be somewhat incongruous.
// The remaining question is how to tell the AccessibleElement whether it should register to observe the accessibility API's destruction notification so as to post its own destruction notification and call its delegate method. Observing an element's destruction involves some expense, so clients should be allowed to create AccessibleElement instances for purposes other than display that do not waste time dealing with their own destruction. The Objective-C way to do this would be to implement separate initializers. For Swift, we can use optional parameters.
// The AccessibleElement's designated initializer declares an optional Boolean parameter, observesDestruction, that defaults to true: init?(axElement: AXUIElement, observesDestruction: Bool = true). Because of this, the most common and complex use of AccessibleElement objects, in a data source used to display the accessibility hierarchy, requires the simplest calls to the framework. Initialize each new element by calling AccessibleElement(axElement) and set its delegate property, and by default the element will observe the destruction of the AXUIElement object it wraps, post its elementWasDestroyedNotification to the Notification Center when it is destroyed in case anybody is observing it, and, if the element property has been set by the client, call the client's elementWasDestroyed delegate method and pass the notification object to it. When a client wants to create a single, temporary AccessibleElement object, instead, without the expense of observing its destruction, the client can call the initializer with an explicit observesDestruction parameter set to false: AccessibleElement(axElement, observesDestruction: false).

// NOTE about Core Foundation types.
// Accessibility is a Core Foundation API, and it uses CFTypeRef types such as AXUIElement (formerly AXUIElementRef). AnyObject is the Swift form of Core Foundation's CFTypeRef base type, a generic object reference type used as a placeholder for Core Foundation objects. From Apple's "Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C (Swift 4)": "When Swift imports Core Foundation types, the compiler remaps the names of these types. The compiler removes Ref from the end of each type name because all Swift classes are reference types, therefore the suffix is redundant. The Core Foundation CFTypeRef type completely remaps to the AnyObject type. Wherever you would use CFTypeRef, you should now use AnyObject in your code."
// Accessibility API constants of type CFString (formerly CFStringRef) are typed in Swift as String. These constants must therefore be cast to type CFString when calling accessibility API functions directly and cast to type String when using the constants in Swift code such as switch statements.

// NOTE about accessibility and the process identifier (PID).
// The AccessibleElement class declared here assumes that every application and other process supporting accessibility has a valid PID and that a process without a valid PID cannot support accessibility. For this reason, AccessibleElement's init?(axElement:observesDestruction:) designated initializer fails if the provided AXUIElement object has a PID value that is nil or negative, and it always tests the result of AXUIElementGetPid(_:_:) function calls for errors and for an invalid nil or negative result. These precaustions are implemented because Apple's documentation leaves open the possibility that there may be applications or other processes that have no PID or a negative PID.
// Apple's accessibility API has only one function, AXUIElementCreateApplication(_:), that creates a new AXUIElement from scratch; that is, without deriving it from an existing AXUIElement that already has a reference to its application's PID. According to its reference documentation, the AXUIElementCreateApplication(_:) function requires "the process ID of an application" as its only parameter, and it returns the AXUIElement "representing the top-level accessibility object for the application with the specified process ID." This suggests that an AXUIElement without a PID cannot be created by an assistive application.
// The documentation for the accessibility API's AXUIElementGetPid() function similarly states without qualification that it indirectly returns "the process ID associated with the specified accessibility object." The only errors it is specifically documented to return are for illegal or invalid parameters. There is no mention of a negative indirect return value of the PID. This, too, suggests that a valid AXUIElement always has a valid PID.
// Nevertheless, the reference documentation for NSRunningApplication notes with respect to its convenience initializer, init?(processIdentifier:), that "Applications that do not have PIDs cannot be returned from this method." NSRunningApplication inherits from NSObject, so NSRunningApplication objects can also be initialized without a PID using NSObject's init() method, which according to its documentation never returns nil. All of this suggests that there may be running applications that do not have a PID. The NSRunningApplication documentation makes this explicit when it notes with respect to its processIdentifier property that "Not all applications have a pid." The processIdentifier property documentation goes on to state, "Applications without a pid return a value of -1."
// Online commentary suggests that the warnings in the NSRunningApplication documentation about applications without a PID might have been a hedge against rare or unknown situations, and we have never seen a process that has no PID or a negative PID listed in the Activity Monitor application. The AccessibleElement class nevertheless checks for an invalid nil or negative PID in case a client attempts to use a negative PID returned by the NSRunningApplication processIdentifier property.

/**
 A user interface element that can be explored, monitored and controlled by an assistive application or other accessibility client.
 
 The `AccessibleElement` class wraps a Core Foundation `AXUIElement` object. It allows an assistive application or other accessibility client to exercise all of the powers made available by Apple's accessibility API using standard Swift code. In addition, it enhances the power of the accessibility API and increases its ease of use by making familiar techniques like delegate methods and notifications readily available. These support the ability to observe the destruction of an element in the user interface.

    // MARK: - INITIALIZATION
    
    /**
     Initializes a new instance of a system-wide, application or interface AccessibleElement.
        
     A valid Core Foundation accessibility API `AXUIElement` object must be provided to enable the `AccessibleElement` to explore, monitor and control the element using Apple's accessibility API. An `AccessibleElement` with an `axElement` that has been destroyed or invalidated is considered invalid.
         
     The initializer fails if the `axElement`'s `role` attribute cannot be obtained, without regard to the nature of the error, because every `AXUIElement` must have a role attribute. This prevents creation of a new instance after an element has been destroyed. From Apple's *Application Services* reference documentation for `kAXRoleAttribute`: "All accessibility objects must include this attribute."
     
     The optional `observesDestruction` parameter defaults to `true` and may be omitted. By using the initializer with the default parameter value, the client can handle the element's destruction by implementing an `elementWasDestroyed(_:)` delegate method or registering to observe an `elementWasDestroyedNotification`. The `observesDestruction` parameter can be passed explicitly as `false` to create a temporary `AccessibleElement` for special purposes that does not observe the element's destruction; for example, to compare it with other `AccessibleElements` obtained from the user interface.
     
     Clients typically do not create new instances of `AccessibleElement` by using the designated initializer. Instead, they might create an `AccessibleElement` representing a leaf element existing in the user interface by reading the screen using a utility method such as [[[+[PFUIElement elementAtPoint:withDelegate:error:]???]]]. Alternatively, they might create a root application `AccessibleElement` using the `applicationElement(forProcessIdentifier)` class method or a system-wide `AccessibleElement` using the `systemWideElement()` class method, and then use properties such as `AXParent` or `AXChildren` to traverse the accessibility hierarchy to create `AccessibleElements` representing existing user interface elements. See PFiddlesoft's *Assistive Application Programming Guide* for more information.
         
     A client can create as many instances of `AccessibleElement` as desired, as often as desired, even if they refer to the same element. All instances that refer to the same element in the user interface are considered equal.
         
     For application elements only, the initializer sets up a class registration mechanism for possible use by subclasses.
        
     For interface elements only, the initializer creates a `cachedAttributes` array containing the `AccessibleElement`'s `role` attribute and, if they exist, its `roleDescription`, `subrole`, `help` and `title` attributes keyed to accessibility API attribute constants. The cached attributes can be used to describe a user interface element after it is destroyed. An application or system-wide element does not create a `cachedAttributes` dictionary.
     
     For interface elements only, if the `observesDestruction` parameter value is `true`, the initializer creates and installs a private accessibility API `AXObserver` object in order to be notified when the element is destroyed; for example, when a window or menu is closed. When the destruction observer callback closure declared here is triggered, it calls the `handleDestruction()` method to set the `isDestroyed` and `isValid` properties to true; it posts an `elementWasDestroyedNotification` to the Notification Center so clients can observe it; and if a delegate conforming to the `AccessibleElementDelegate` protocol has been set, it calls the delegate's `elementWasDestroyed(_:) delegate method. The `elementWasDestroyedNotification` is declared in an extension on Notification.Name at the end of this file. Application and system-wide instances do not participate in the destruction observer mechanism. The delegate parameter is optional; if omitted, it is nil.
         
     The initializer's `required` modifier is necessary because `AccessibleElement` conforms to the `NSCopying` protocol.
     
     - parameter axElement: `AXUIElement` object represented by an `AccessibleElement`.
     
     - parameter observesDestruction: `Bool` value controlling whether an `AccessibleElement` observes the destruction of the `axElement` in the user interface.
