# UI Browser 4

As bart of the [handover by Bill Cheeseman of his UI Browser application to Late Night Software](https://latenightsw.com/freeware/ui-browser/), we received the source code to an unfinished UI Browser 4.  UI Browser 4 is a rewrite of UI Browser in Swift.

In accordance with Bill's wishes, the UI Browser 4 source code is available to the public as open source project in this repository.

## Status

The project builds and runs with Apple's Xcode 14.

UI Browser 4 is an **UNFINISHED WORK** and is not fully usable in its current form.

The source code mentions UI Browser 3 in a number of places.  Despite these references, this is not the UI Browser 3 source code and cannot be altered to produce the existing UI Browser 3 application.

## Requirements

- macOS Monterey or later
- Xcode 14 or later

## Building

- clone this repository
- open the `UI Browser.xcworkspace` project using Xcode 14
- issue the Build > Run menu command run the application

## Contributions

Contributions to UI Browser 4 are welcome.  Please submit pull requests for any updates you would like to contribute to the application.  

Late Night Software will produce and host UI Browser 4 releases as new versions are developed.

## Support/Discussion

Late Night Software maintains a section on it's on-line forum for [UI Browser user discussions](https://forum.latenightsw.com/c/uibrowser/17).
