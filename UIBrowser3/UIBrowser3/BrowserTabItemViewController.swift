/**
 `BrowserTabItemViewController` receives a `tab items` relationship segue triggered by `MasterTabViewController` in *Main.storyboard*. Because it is designated as the Selected or default master tab view item in *Main.storyboard* and the master split pane is visible by default at first application launch, it is always instantiated at launch. It calls `loadView()` to instantiate and load the tab view item's view.
 
 UI Browser's master (top) split view pane displays the UI elements in the target's current accessibility hierarchy in one of three tab view items, each of which contains a different kind of view; namely, a browser view, an outline view, and a list view. `BrowserTabItemViewController` controls the browser view, created in *Main.storyboard*. All three of these element views rely on a common shared repository or data source for the data they display, which is cached in the `ElementDataModel` singleton object that serves as UI Browser's model object in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The data model is updated lazily on the fly by `BrowserTabItemViewController` as the user chooses different targets and uses the mouse or keyboard to select various elements in the path control or the browser view.
 
 UI Browser uses the NSBrowserDelegate's item-based data source delegate methods introduced in Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) to manage the data model when it is displayed in the browser view. The matrix-based delegate methods were deprecated in OS X Yosemite 10.10. As noted in the AppKit Release Notes for Snow Leopard: "NSBrowser no longer caches the contents of each column. Instead it depends on the data source to provide speedy results." Per the AppKit Release Notes for OS X Yosemite 10.10, "Matrix-based NSBrowsers are ... deprecated in favor of the item-based interface" as part of the general trend to deprecate cells.
 
 The browser view is empty after *Main.storyboard* is loaded at launch. Only when the user chooses a target does the browser view display a single item in the first column, known in the accessibility world as the "root application UI element." If the target is a running application and not the system-wide element, it also then shows the children of the root application element in the second column; typically, these are the application's menu bar element and a window element for every open application window. The root application element is not to be confused with NSBrowser's "root item", a support object that is used as a starting point to manage any NSBrowser view. UI Browser's behavior in this regard differs from Apple's item-based NSBrowser examples *SimpleCocoaBrowser*, *ComplexBrowser* and *AnimatedTableView*. Those examples display the browser's root item in a header, and they display the root item's children in the first column when the browser's nib file is loaded, with none of them selected and nothing displayed in the second column. The *Main.storyboard* Attribute inspector's `Browser Selection Empty` setting must be turned off to avoid problems when there is no current target.
 
 In accordance with Apple's reliance on the data source for "speedy results" in an item-based browser, as noted above, UI Browser separates the data model from the data's display and implements the data source methods in this `BrowserTabItemViewController` to manage the model. The shared singleton `ElementDataModel` object is an opaque object modeling the current target's accessibility hierarchy. In response to the user choosing a target or selecting an element with the mouse or keyboard, `BrowserTabItemViewController` uses its NSBrowserDelegate data source methods to modify the model's contents accordingly so that it can later retrieve them and tell the browser view to display them. `ElementDataModel` adds objects to the data repository by calling accessibility API functions through our *PFAssistiveFramework4* framework. It constructs a variety of objects that are cached in the model object for use when the browser view displays them. Getting all of these data model operations out of the way once before the user's selection is displayed greatly improves performance, because the operations do not have to be performed repeatedly thereafter while the user navigates the display. The data source retrieval and display methods do not use any accessibility API functions themselves, but instead use the data source methods to retrieve the precomputed information from the data model. This caching of precomputed data source information allows rapid scrolling and window resizing, rapid user switching among the three element tab item views, and other features such as the continued display of elements after they have been destroyed in the user interface and are no longer available to accessibility functions.
 
 // TODO: Review this after conforming browser view to outline and list view and adding path control.
 [[[The browser view's action method is `selectElement(_:)`. It is called explicitly once when the user chooses a new target while the browser view is selected, to select the target in the browser view. It is called repeatedly thereafter when the user selects an existing element in the browser view with the mouse or keyboard, because the `selectElement(_:)` action method is connected to `BrowserTabItemViewController`'s `First Responder` in *Main.storyboard*. It is called after the data source methods have updated the data model. The action method updates UI Browser's display, adding the child elements of the selected element and other views, such as the tab view items showing actions, attributes and notifications of the selected element.???]]]
 
 The OutlineTabItemViewController and ListTabItemViewController classes are set up like BrowserTabItemViewController, but they conform to the NSOutlineViewDataSource and NSTableViewDataSource protocols. Those two protocols are separate from the NSOutlineViewDelegate and NSTableViewDelegate protocols, whereas the NSBrowserDelegate protocol contains both delegate and data source methods for browsers in a single protocol.
 
 The browser view's primary navigation tool is a path control at the top of the browser tab view item. See ElementPathControlManager.swift for details. The browser view also supports navigation using the mouse and keyboard to select parent, sibling and child UI elements at any level in the currently displayed outline. A contextual menu like that in the list view is not needed because a browser view already incorporates equivalent functionality.

Action methods with the same selectElement(_:) signature are implemented in the browser view, outline view and list view in the master (top) split item. It is connected programmatically to each menu item in the path control menu.

     This action method also updates the browser view when the user selects an existing element using the mouse or keyboard in the browser view. It is connected to First Responder in the Main.storyboard Browser Tab Item View Controller Scene. The browser view uses an action method for mouse and keyboard selection of elements because NSBrowser is designed to be used this way, even for mouse and keyboard selection; NSBrowserDelegate has no delegate method analogous to the outlineViewSelectionDidChange(_:) or tableViewSelectionDidChange(_:) delegate methods in NSOutlineViewDelegate and NSTableViewDelegate that are used for mouse and keyboard selection in UI Browser's outline and list views. The selectElement(_:) action method could be used in the outline and list views, too, but there the action method would not respond to mouse or keyboard selection; only the outlineViewSelectionDidChange(_:) and tableViewSelectionDidChange(_:) delegate methods respond to mouse and keyboard selection in those two views.
     
     The mouse or keyboard branch of this method uses `NSBrowser`'s `selectRow(_:inColumn:)` method to trigger the delegate methods that refresh the browser view, to allow the user to select an element using the keyboard's arrow keys as well as mouse clicks. The *Main.storyboard*'s Attribute inspector setting for `Browser Navigation "Arrows Send Action"` is turned on.

This action method is also connected to First Responder in the Main.storyboard Browser Tab Item View Controller Scene to handle mouse and keyboard selection.
        
        // NOTE about NSBrowser's clickedRow and clickedColumn properties:
        // The following statement in Apple's NSTableView documentation about a table view's clickedRow and clickedColumn properties applies also to NSBrowser's clickedRow and clickedColumn properties: "The value of this property is meaningful in the target objectâs implementation of the action and double-action methods." UI Browser uses selectedColumn() and selectedRow(inColumn:) instead, but this note is valuable anyway.
        // The NSBrowser documentation incorrectly suggests that, unlike a table view, the browser's clickedRow and clickedColumn properties return the clicked row and column numbers only if the user right-clicked or Control-clicked a browser cell to present a contextual menu. For example, the NSBrowser reference document correctly states that clickedRow returns "The row number of the cell that the user clicked to display a context menu" and that clickedColumn returns "The column number of the cell that the user clicked to display a context menu." However, it incorrectly adds in the Discussion sections that this is true only if the clickedRow or clickedColumn property is called after the click presents a contextual menu and while the contextual menu is open: "The value of this property is -1 if no context menu is active." The NSBrowser.h header file comments for both also correctly state that each of them "Returns the column and row clicked on to display a context menu," but they add, incorrectly, that "These methods will return -1 when no menu is active."
        // The Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) AppKit Release Notes, when these methods were introduced, are more accurate but imply the same limitation to contextual menus: "While the contextual menu is displayed, you may call -[NSBrowser clickedRow] and -[NSBrowser clickedColumn] to determine which cell was underneath the mouse when the context menu was displayed. The return value of both these functions will be -1 if no cell was clicked."
        // Testing demonstrates that these methods actually return the clicked row and column numbers generally for any user click in a browser cell, not just a right-click or Control-click to display a contextual menu, and that they do not in fact return -1 when no context menu is active but only when no cell was clicked. The description of the equivalent NSTableView properties in its reference document in fact applies to NSBrowser, as well. For example, as to clickedColumn, Apple's NSTableView documentation states: "The value is -1 when the user clicks in an area of the table view that is not occupied by columns or when the user clicks a row that is a group separator. The value of this property is meaningful in the target objectâs implementation of the action and double-action methods. You can also use the value to determine which contextual menu to display when the user Control-clicks in a table. Note that the clickedColumn value remains valid when the menu item sends the action message."
        // It appears that the NSBrowser documentation was not meant to suggest that these properties can only be used in connection with contextual menus, but instead to emphasize that, in addition to their normal usage, the properties had added to NSBrowser the ability to present cell-specific context menus, an ability that NSBrowser did not have before Snow Leopard.

This architecture differs from that for UI Browser's outline and list views, which take advantage of the separate data source protocols in NSOutlineViewDataSource and NSTableViewDataSource.
    // The browser view's "root item" is UI Browser's model object in the MVC design pattern. The model object is a private object created and maintained in ElementDataModel. Its data is made available through the ElementDataModel.shared type property and public methods declared in ElementDataModel. The data model is constructed or updated using accessibility API functions made available through the PFAsssistiveFramework4 framework when the user chooses a target application or selects an existing element in the browser view with the mouse or keyboard. After the data model is updated, the NSBrowserDelegate data source methods then retrieve data based on the current state of the data model and information stored in it, rather than calling accessibility API methods. This allows time-consuming accessibility operations to be performed once before the browser view is displayed instead of repeatedly in multiple calls to the framework methods.
    // To implement this workflow when the user chooses a target application from the Target menu, MainContentViewController's choose...Target(_:) action methods (in the TargetMenuExtension.swift file) call the data model's updateApplication(forNewTarget:usingTargetElement:) method. The updateApplication(forNewTarget:usingTargetElement:) method in turn calls updateData(usingTargetElement:), which calls ElementDataModel's updateDataModel(forApplicationElement:) to update the data source with the new target application. If successful, the updateApplication(forNewTarget:usingTargetElement:) method then calls updateView(_:) to call BrowserTabItemViewController's updateView() method. The updateView() method calls NSBrowser's loadColumnZero() to load the root application UI element from the data model, and it calls selectRow(_:inColumn) to programmatically trigger the browser(_:selectRow:inColumn:) optional delegate method and the required NSBrowserDelegate data source delegate methods to display the chosen target's root application UI element. The browser(_:selectRow:inColumn:) optional delegate method then calls ElementDataModel's updateDataModelForCurrentElementAt(level:index:) to add the root application UI element's children to the display.
    // To implement this workflow when the user selects an existing element in the browser view with the mouse or keyboard, BrowserTabItemViewController implements the browser(_:selectRow:inColumn:) delegate method and the selectElement(_:) action method.
    
    // TODO: look for ways to make this faster....
    // ... For columns with large number of siblings, display a temporary "Loading..." item in the column if necessary then reload the column with valid entries. Or load it in chunks, with the first chunk big enough to display all, and subsequent chunks loaded in the background while the user reads the first chunk
    
    // MARK: NSBrowserDelegate
    
    // MARK: required item-based data source delegate methods
    // All of the required item-based data source delegate methods are passed an object in the item parameter containing information about a UI element to be displayed. The type of the object is private to ElementDataModel, and the information it caches is available to other UI Browser classes only through ElementDataModel public methods. The object was created and cached in ElementDataModel's updateDataModel(forApplicationElement:) or updateDataModelForCurrentElementAt(level:index:) method when the user chose a target application or selected an existing element. The object is introduced into each round of data source delegate method calls by the browser(_:child:ofItem:) delegate method.

When the user chooses a new target application, one of the choose...Target action methods results in a call to updateView(), which calls NSBrowser loadColumnZero() to trigger the browser's data source methods to display the root application UI element, and it then calls NSBrowser selectRow(_:inColumn:) to trigger this delegate method to add the application element's children.

As a result, the browser would not be updated when the user selects an element that is already in the selection path. This is efficient in the general case from NSBrowser's point of view, because descendant elements in the browser are presumed to remain valid and it would be a waste of time to remove them.

        // Due to a longstanding Apple bug, an NSBrowser column title fails to display when the browser scrolls horizontally and a hidden column becomes visible. In very early versions of macOS, the bug affected columns scrolled into view from the right, and UI Browser worked around it by implementing the -browserDidScroll: delegate method and calling -setNeedsDisplayInRect: on the title frame of the last column. That workaround failed in Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), but UI Browser was then surprisingly able to work around the bug simply by selecting the Titled checkbox in Interface Builder instead of calling -setTitled: in -awakeFromNib. See my posts to Apple's cocoa-dev mailing list at https://lists.apple.com/archives/cocoa-dev/2011/Sep/msg00136.html. That workaround failed in macOS Mojave 10.14, and the bug now affects columns scrolled into view from the left. Testing reveals that a hidden column does in fact have a title, but it may be significant that the browser(_:titleOfColumn:) delegate method is not called when the column scrolls into view. UI Browser now works around the bug by implementing the browserWillScroll(_:) delegate method and calling setTitle(_:ofColumn:) on each visible column. Because the column already has a title supplied by a previous call to the browser(_:titleOfColumn:) delegate method, this workaround is able to get the title directly by calling title(ofColumn:) instead of calling the delegate method again. The key step in the workaround is the call to setTitle(_:ofColumn:), which has the side effect of displaying the title.

    // MARK: - PROTOCOL METHODS
    
    // MARK: NSToolTipOwner informal protocol
    // The use of this technique to implement custom tooltips in an item-based NSBrowser object was suggested by Ken Thomases in a mailing list post on May 5, 2014: "you can use -[NSView addToolTipRect:owner:userData:] to add a tooltip rect covering the whole browser view (and update it when its bounds change). Set the owner to an object which implements the NSToolTipOwner informal protocol â i.e. the -view:stringForToolTip:point:userData: method. In that method, you can translate from the point to a row and column and return an appropriate string."
    // An alternative "is browser:shouldShowCellExpansionForRow:column: which does not allow for a custom tooltip, only the display of the entire cell contents if the cell contents doesn't fit in the column." UI Browser currently does this by setting Allows Expansion Tooltips in the Interface Builder nib file.
    // This code was used in UI Browser when it used the now deprecated matrix-based NSBrowser delegate methods:
    /* NSBrowser does not support tooltips for item-based browsers. The following code is from the pre-Snow Leopard matrix-based browser:
     // Attach tooltip to cell to report its value, if any.
     if (element) {
     NSString *toolTipText = [self descriptionOfAttributeValue:[element AXValue] ofType:[element typeForAttribute:NSAccessibilityValueAttribute] element:element];
     if ([toolTipText length] > 0) {
     toolTipText = [NSString stringWithFormat:NSLocalizedString(@"Value: %@", @"Prefix to tooltip for value of UI Element"), toolTipText];
     if ([toolTipText length] > 256) toolTipText = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@%C", [toolTipText substringToIndex:255], (unichar)0x2026]; // 0x2026 is Unicode ellipsis
     NSMatrix *matrix = [browser matrixInColumn:column];
     [matrix setToolTip:toolTipText forCell:cell];

CopyProcessName is documented to work with multilingual names, unlike GetProcessInformation. Called from -tellBlockWrapperShortScript and -tellBlockWrapperSafeScript, and from -descriptionForAppleScriptOfElement:atDepth: to get the name of the application reference while constructing a reference to a UI element. Also called from the modifiedObjectValueForCell method for NSLog entries.
