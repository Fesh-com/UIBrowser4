/**
 `MainWindowController` is designated as the *Initial Controller* (the default setting) in its Attributes inspector in *Main.storyboard*, and it is therefore instantiated when *Main.storyboard* is loaded at application launch. Its `loadWindow()` method is called automatically to instantiate and load the main window. `MainWindowController`'s `window` outlet is automatically connected to the window and the window's `delegate` outlet is manually connected to `MainWindowController` in *Main.storyboard*. `MainWindowController` triggers the window content segue automatically connected to `MainContentViewController` in *Main.storyboard*. See `MainContentViewController` for further flow of excecution.
 
 The window has two areas, the toolbar and the content view. The toolbar is at the top of the window below the title bar, and it contains several toolbar items of global import. The toolbar is managed by MainWindowController, which declares the toolbar items' IBOutlets, and by several extensions on MainWindowController that manage the individual toolbar items. The content view is at the bottom of the window and is filled by the main split view. The content view is managed by MainContentViewController and the controllers for the split view, its split view items, and their tab item views.
 
 The settings that are controlled by the toolbar items impact UI elements in the window's content view. For this reason, MainWindowController, its extensions for individual toolbar items, and the subclasses of NSToolbarItem are limited to management of the toolbar items themselves, while their more general impacts are managed by MainContentViewController. MainContentViewController also manages the toolbar items in response to global changes.
 
 Toolbar item validation is handled by overriding NSToolbarItem in ValidatedToolbarItem.swift, as described in <https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Toolbars/Tasks/ValidatingTBItems.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000753-BAJGFHDD>. Validation of UI elements in the content view is handled separately by UI Browser's UserControlValidations protocol and its `ValidatedUserControlItem` subprotocol of the `NSValidatedUserInterfaceItem` formal protocol, both of which are declared in UserControlValidation.swift.
 
 Validation of menu items in the menubar that have the same action as a toolbar item is handled by the validateMenuItem(_:) NSMenuItemValidation formal protocol method implemented here, in the target of the action method.

        // Called when the user closes the window, not when the user explicitly quits the application.
        // Returns false to prevent the window from closing and, in the next iteration of the run loop, terminates the application. This technique allows the user to terminate the application by closing the main window even if other windows and panels remain open. It takes the place of returning true in AppDelegate's applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed(_:) delegate method, which does not terminate the application when the main window is closed if other windows (as opposed to panels) remain open. Using this technique is appropriate for a library-style or "shoebox" application like UI Browser that has no standalone windows other than the main window, but only secondary or auxiliary windows. This technique avoids having to make all secondary windows panels.
        // Because the window remains open until the application is terminated a moment later, the frameAutosaveName mechanism will automatically use its last size and position when the application is relaunched and reopens the window. If, instead of using this technique, AppDelegate's applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed(_:) delegate method were implemented to return true, the frameAutosaveName mechanism would be unable to save the frame if the user quit by closing the main window because the window would no longer be open. As a result, the window would reopen at its default size and position when the application was relaunched; the window would only reopen at its saved size and position if the user quit by using the Quit command while the window was open.
        // The Autosave setting in the window's storyboard scene is set to "MainWindowAutosaveName". In addition, the Behavior - Restorable setting is turned on (the default setting), which allows the frameAutosaveName mechanism to work and also automatically saves the position and collapsed status of the main split view. Additional code is required to implement autosaving and restoration of the selected tab view items in the tab views; see restorableStateKeyPaths() in TopTabViewController and BottomTabViewController.
