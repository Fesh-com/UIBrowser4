/**
 *Main.storyboard*'s *Application Scene* contains UI Browser's shared *Application* object with its *Main Menu* and *AppDelegate* objects. *Info.plist* designates *Main.storyboard* as the application's `NSMainStoryboardFile`, so the standard main function loads *Main.storyboard* and its *Application*, *Main Menu* and *AppDelegate* objects at launch. *Main.storyboard* designates `MainWindowController` as its *Initial Controller* (this is the default setting; the *Is Initial Controller* setting is selected in the *MainWindowController Scene*'s Attributes inspector). It therefore also instantiates `MainWindowController` at launch. See `MainWindowController` for further flow of excecution.
 
 `AppDelegate` conforms to the `NSApplicationDelegate` protocol, and it is connected to the *Application* object's `delegate` property in *Main.storyboard*. `AppDelegate` also conforms to the `NSMenuDelegate` protocol to respond to menu items in the Application's main menu bar, but it may call methods in `MainToolbarController`, `MainContentViewController` or subcontrollers when menus or other controls that do identical work exist in the main window.
 
 The user's first step after launching UI Browser is to choose a target in order to examine, monitor and control the User Interface elements in the target's accessibility hierarchy. UI Browser's model object is `ElementDataModel`, an array of arrays of dictionaries representing the hierarchy, and the current running application target always provides the root UI element of the current hierarchy. The user chooses the target by using the Target menu in UI Browser's main menu bar or the identical Target menu in the main window toolbar's Target pop-up button. UI Browser updates the main menu bar's Target menu when it is opened by calling `AppDelegate`'s `menuNeedsUpdate(_:)` `NSMenuDelegate` protocol method, which in turn calls `MainContentViewController`'s `updateTargetMenu(_:)` utility method (in *TargetMenuExtension.swift*) to do the work. `MainContentViewController` also implements the `menuNeedsUpdate(_:)` `NSMenuDelegate` protocol method. UI Browser updates the identical menu in the main window toolbar's Target pop-up button when it is opened by calling the `MainContentViewController`'s `menuNeedsUpdate(_:)` `NSMenuDelegate` protocol method, which also calls the same `updateTargetMenu(_:)` utility method to do the work.
 
 `MainContentViewController`'s `updateTargetMenu(_:)` method sets represented objects and action methods for both Target menus' menu items. All of these action methods and their supporting utility methods are implemented in `MainContentViewController` (in *TargetMenuExtension.swift*), which mediates between the model object and the main window's views in accordance with the *MVC* design pattern. `MainContentViewController` declares a `runningApplicationTarget` instance property, which the action methods update based on the user's choice of a target from either Target menu. `MainContentViewController`'s `updateTargetMenu(_:)` method uses its `runningApplicationTarget` value to place a checkmark on the menu item representing the current selection.
 
 See `MainWindowController` and `MainContentViewController` for additional information.
